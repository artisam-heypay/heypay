# escrow — HeyPay settlement-escrow contract

Soroban contract that holds a payer's funds under a job id until HeyPay either
releases them to the treasury (payout succeeded) or refunds them to the payer
(payout failed). If HeyPay never acts, the payer can self-refund once the
job's deadline ledger has passed.

## Build and test

```sh
pnpm contract:build   # target/wasm32v1-none/release/escrow.wasm
pnpm contract:test    # cargo test -p escrow
```

Requires the Stellar CLI (`brew install stellar-cli`) and the `wasm32v1-none`
Rust target (`rustup target add wasm32v1-none`).
