# escrow — HeyPay settlement-escrow contract

Soroban contract that holds a payer's funds under a job id until HeyPay either
releases them to the treasury (payout succeeded) or refunds them to the payer
(payout failed). If HeyPay never acts, the payer can self-refund once the
job's deadline ledger has passed.

## Build and test

```sh
pnpm contract:build   # target/wasm32v1-none/release/escrow.wasm
pnpm contract:test    # cargo test -p escrow
```

Requires the Stellar CLI (`brew install stellar-cli`) and the `wasm32v1-none`
Rust target (`rustup target add wasm32v1-none`).

## Setup

`initialize(admin, token)` runs once. `admin` is the HeyPay operator account
and `token` is the Stellar Asset Contract address of the asset held. Call it
right after deploying, so no one else can initialize the contract first.

### Additions to the SOW interface

- `set_timeout(ledgers)` (admin only) changes the payer self-refund window.
  The default is 17,280 ledgers (~24h). It exists so the timeout-refund demo
  can use a short deadline.
- `admin()`, `token()` and `timeout()` are read-only getters.
